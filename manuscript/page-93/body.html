So she could not sell it without first consulting him.</p><p>Quickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juliâ€™s rosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but two hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned, but Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold and Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest and cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could not be done because the owner was not present.</p></div> </div>
