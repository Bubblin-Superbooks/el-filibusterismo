You know that he’s a good fellow, never marks absences or asks about the lesson.

Come, Placido, you start it, so you’ll be at the head of the list.”</p><p>Then, seeing that Placido gave the two pesos without hesitation, he added, “Listen, put up four, and afterwards I’ll return you two. They’ll serve as a decoy.”</p><p>“Well, if you’re going to return them to me, why give them to you? It’ll be sufficient, for you to write four.”</p></div> </div>
